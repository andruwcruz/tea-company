# Tea Company Website

![tea-company](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andruwcruz/tea-company/master/images/tea-company.jpg)

This repo is a website design I worked on with an impatient client that didn't get launched properly.

Built using WordPress with Bootstrap mixed in with js and css animations.
